### Program Overview
Create a MIPS assembly program that:
1. Defines an integer array with a few elements.
2. Prints each element of the array to the console, followed by a space.
3. Terminates gracefully.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Define Data Section
- Start by defining the data section of your program. This section will contain the array of integers you want to print, the size of the array, and a space character for printing between numbers.
- Declare an array named `array` with a few integer values.
- Declare a word `size` that holds the size of the array.
- Declare a string `space` that contains a single space character for output formatting.

#### 2. Initialize Program
- Begin the text section with a `main` label.
- Load the base address of the array into a temporary register (e.g., `$t0`). This register will be used to access array elements.
- Load the size of the array into another temporary register (e.g., `$t1`). This will be used to control the loop iteration.
- Initialize a counter (e.g., `$t2`) to 0. This counter will keep track of the current index in the array.

#### 3. Loop through the Array
- Start a loop. At the beginning of each iteration, compare the counter with the array size to determine if the loop should continue.
- If the counter equals the array size, jump to the loop end step to exit the loop.

#### 4. Print Array Element
- Set up a system call to print an integer. Load the appropriate syscall number into `$v0`.
- Load the current array element (pointed to by the base address register) into `$a0`.
- Perform the syscall to print the integer.

#### 5. Print a Space
- Set up another system call, this time for printing a string.
- Load the address of the space character into `$a0`.
- Perform the syscall to print the space.

#### 6. Increment and Iterate
- Increment the base address register by 4 to point to the next integer in the array.
- Increment the counter by 1.
- Jump back to the start of the loop to process the next element.

#### 7. Loop End and Program Exit
- After exiting the loop, set up the final step to terminate the program.
- Load the syscall number for program termination into `$v0`.
- Perform the syscall to exit the program.

### Summary
This guide provides a high-level overview of constructing a MIPS assembly program that iterates over an array and prints each element followed by a space. It covers initializing program data, looping through array elements, printing values, and exiting the program. Encourage your students to translate these steps into actual MIPS assembly instructions, fostering a deeper understanding of assembly language programming and the MIPS architecture.
